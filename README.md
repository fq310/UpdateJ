UpdateJ
=======

This is a tool for me to update the Ant xml files in my working project which is based on Eclipse RCP.
As Eclipse updating, we have to update our Ant building files which contain the referenced jar information that ends with certain version numbers.
But we have more than 20 projects and each of them contains 4 build files.
Manully updating the version numbers is silly.
So here is the tool for me to update them in a second.

Based on java and used a html page as the GUI part.
Totally cross platform and small enough, and look 100% the same on any OS.


Special thanks to nanohttp: https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd as the communication tool between java side and html page.
